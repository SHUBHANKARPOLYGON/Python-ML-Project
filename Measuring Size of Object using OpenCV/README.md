# 📏Measuring Size of Object using OpenCV

- This Python script processes an image to detect objects, draw bounding boxes around them, and calculate their dimensions and area in centimeters. The calculation is based on a reference object with a known size in the image.


### Install libraries 
```
Clone the repository or download the script.
```
```
 pip install numpy
 pip install opencv-python
```

- Then Run in Terminal in your prefered Ide.
```
 python app.py
```

### Update the Variables (if needed)

- ```reference_width_cm```: Real-world width of the reference object in centimeters.
- ```reference_contour```: Update or determine the reference object's bounding box if needed.
